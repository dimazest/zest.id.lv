As a computational linguist I'm mostly interested in **compositional
distributional semantics** and its application to **dialog analysis**. As a
computer scientist I'm interested in **distributed systems**, automated
**testing** and **big data**. Finally, as programmer I'm interested in
**Python**. Check my `CV <{filename}/static/dmilajevs_cv.pdf>`__ for more
details.
